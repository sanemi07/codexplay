npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Authentication

This project uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication with a Prisma adapter and MongoDB.  
Routes are protected using a custom middleware (`middleware.ts`) and route configuration (`routes.ts`).

- Public routes: Defined in `routes.ts` as `publicRoutes`
- Protected routes: Defined in `routes.ts` as `protectedRoutes`
- Auth routes: Defined in `routes.ts` as `authRoutes`

## Database

- Uses [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) with a MongoDB datasource.
- Prisma schema is located at `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- To generate the Prisma client, run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

- To apply schema changes, run:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
